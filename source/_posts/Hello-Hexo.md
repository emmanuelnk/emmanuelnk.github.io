For a while now I've been growing weary of self-hosted Wordpress (for blogging purposes). The platform is old, bloated and feels like that car that you own that keeps breaking down but you can't just let go.

There's nothing worse than logging into Wordpress, finding one million things that need to be updated and losing all your energy to blog. Or even worse, opening up your site to see "Hacked By Mister Spy" because of some server/plugin vulnerability that left your site to the wolves. Ughh.

Wordpress (self-hosted) isn't a terrible platform. It just has too many dependencies and machinery for someone interested in making a simple blog. You will be at the mercy of plugin developers and their ability to keep their code up to date. And if you're like me (more of a Javascripter than PHPer), with Wordpress, you will also lose control of many design aspects of your site and will have to rely on the free and premium themes out there unless you're willing to dive deep into Wordpress/PHP design code.

So you can imagine my elation when one fateful day I came across an amazing article on the benefits of static sites for blogging. I had heard about static sites obviously but didn't realize the existence of whole blogging platforms that utilize this principle. I quickly learned that static blogging sites are much easier to secure, they are blazingly fast, cheap to host (think github pages, heroku) and come with version control. This was perfect for me.

Now if you've been reading into static blogging, you may think that it's hard if you're not a coder. That isn't true. Top static blogging platforms like Jekyll, Hugo and Hexo comes with loads of pre-made themes that make it very easy for the non-coder to start right away. And creating posts with ugly markdown? Well there's services that simplify that if you don't want to get into the down and ugly. See: {% link Prose http://prose.io %} or {% link Siteleaf https://www.siteleaf.com/ %}

Another thing I love about Static blogging is the control I get over the design. I designed my own theme template for my blog. Coming in from a CSS3/HTML5/BOOTSTRAP/JS/NODE foundation, this was very easy for me to do. I didn't have to go take apart a wordpress theme to fit it up to my standards. I wanted something minimal, beautiful but interesting. Something with wide spaces for easy reading and little quirky animations here and there. It would have taken me ages to find a wordpress theme like this but it only took me an hour in Bootstrap Studio to get the skeleton of my site down.

Now that I had convinced myself to make the switch to a static blog, the final part was choosing a platform. This honestly wasn't very hard for me though. The three largest static blogging platforms are Jekyll, Hugo and Hexo. Jekyll was my first choice because it had the largest community and documentation but I soon realized I wasn't ready to commit to learning Ruby just for this effort. Hexo was the obvoius answer since it generates through NodeJS. Perfect.

Hexo docs are pretty lean and it took me a few days to get into the flow of things and designing my own Hexo theme. I am happy with the result and still constantly working on imroving it as I learn more about Hexo. I will eventually clean up the code and release this theme as free to download to the Hexo community when it's all done!

My next post will be about my Hexo blog and theme creation process. Stay tuned!
