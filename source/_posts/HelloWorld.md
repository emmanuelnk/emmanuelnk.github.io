Aahh… The customary first Word Press post.

Hello World.

I’m Emmanuel.

This is my fifth WordPress install. The first site I ever created never lived beyond localhost. It was banished to the phantom zone (dead or missing WAMP folders). However, it taught me a great deal about HTML, PHP, CSS, phpmyadmin yada yada. Had a pretty slick name too.

theRogueDash.com …

I’m really good at website url names. I know that for a fact.

My second site lived long enough to be adopted by a kind and friendly Hong Kong webserver. It was called buntufang.com. It was meant to be a community site for Ugandan students in China. The name meant ‘buntu’ (Bantu word for people) plus ‘fang’, Chinese mandarin word for ‘house’. You get the idea. It lived for one year and met its end at the hands of my vicious empty pockets and my even bloodier laziness. It was a grand site. It was slick and completely unrecognizable from the original free theme I initially used. I changed one million things and made it a power house of a website. It had forums powered by phpbb. It had classifieds, slick responsive galleries, cool search bar etc It was truly Frankenstein’s monster.  
I soon however realized what the hardest thing in making a website was:

Content.

I mean, if you don’t have anything to say, post, advertise or sell, then your site is essentially useless. I’m a good web developer. I won’t say I’m a pro but I’m better than average. I learned a lot of technical stuff in a short period of time but I didn’t have experience in content generation. My site was bulletproof with every kind of security plugin installed and all holes and cracks sealed proper. It was like a pricey looking, shiny and robust money safe with no money inside. I probably should have sold it. Instead I let the lease on the domain name expire and didn’t bother renewing the hosting service. What has truly become of it, I really have no idea in the least.

My third WordPress install was for a friend who was trying to make some kind of sample of a medical personnel database. This time I was smarter and more efficient. I had most of the stuff done and working in one night. From recently obtained experience I had learned that the power of WordPress lay in its vast repository of free and paid themes and plugins.  I used a lot of cracked plugins to give him the basic idea of what it would take to make something like that. He couldn’t believe I had made the site in a day. WordPress FTW! Anyways, I didn’t have enough time to work on it with him some more since I was due to return to Beijing to pursue my Master’s degree. But I left him with all the files to further build on it at will.

My fourth WordPress install lived on to be a site that is still existing as of this writing. I won’t link it since it’s an institution page. Yes, I made a website for a learning institution! Big things for this slightly better than average web developer! Took me a week to get it up and running and a few more weeks to put in all the proper content etc I can say that it is one of my finest works and I took a very minimalist approach to  its design. This is another lesson I learned about web design: Too many things going on a website, especially in 2016, looks bad. Very bad. So I learned to do a lot with very little.

Which brings me to my fifth WordPress install: deStacked.

This time I know what to do.

Very minimalist for fast loading and easy reading. Structured as a blog and not much else because all I will talk about is projects I engage in and my life here in Beijing. I don’t want to promise too much lest I never post again and find deStacked banished to the phantom zone in a year.

About me:  
Research student of electronics, information engineering, programming and life. I’m Ugandan too {oyeee!} I’ve lived in China since 2010 and I’m only seriously starting my blog now. What a waste of human space I am.

What does deStacked mean?

I’ll be honest:deStacked doesn’t mean anything. It just sounds awesome. And I could get a domain name. Yay!

Hopefully a meaning will grow out of whatever it is I do here.
